# Wine Quality Prediction with Machine Learning

# Introduction
The quality of wine is of paramount importance to both consumers and the wine manufacturing industries. In the ever-growing global market, industries are increasingly leveraging product quality certification to boost their value and sales. Wine is a ubiquitous beverage worldwide, and ensuring its quality through certification has become essential.

Traditionally, wine quality assessment was performed at the end of the production process. However, this approach was time-consuming and resource-intensive, as it required a variety of human experts to assess product quality. Moreover, human subjectivity made it challenging to consistently determine wine quality.
While there are numerous features available for predicting wine quality, not all of them are equally relevant for accurate prediction. This research aims to identify the key wine features that significantly impact the quality by implementing machine learning classification algorithms. The algorithms under consideration include:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Na√Øve Bayes (NB)
- KNN-Classifier
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest Classifier
We will utilize a wine quality dataset to train and test our models.

# Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the performance of our models, we will consider the following metrics:

- Accuracy: A measure of how often the model's predictions are correct.
- Confusion Matrix: A visual representation of the model's performance in terms of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

# Usage

# Conclusion
This project aims to determine the most important wine features for predicting quality and assess the performance of various machine learning classification algorithms in achieving this goal. The insights gained from this research can be valuable for both wine enthusiasts and the wine industry.
